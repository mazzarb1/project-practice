            <p>This is a place for me to store all my creations to share with others and for me to review back to. As time goes on, I will hopefully be able to see a progression, as my knowledge increases, a positive correlation with production value should happen.</p>

                <p>This website in itself is also a project. As I gain skill in web design, this site should start to evolve! Hopefully soon, will have more navigation available, and the ability to make this site more lively.</p>
