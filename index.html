            <p>Hi Everybody!  My name is Brandon Mazzarella, and currently I am a second semester freshman studying Interactive Multimedia at The College Of New Jersey.  So far in my time here, I have done quite a few projects in various forms, and still have many to go!  As a result, I thought it would be cool to have a place to put all my work, and this website is sort of an online portfolio!  I think it will be really cool to see how this site gets filled with stuff, and slowly gets better and better as my skills develop.  This site in itself is a project, and will slowly overtime evolve!  People in the future will be able to see how the progression went, and having completed works will help inspire and give ideas to others!  Furthermore, when I start applying for jobs, ill have art that I can show possible employers!  Thanks for visiting this page, I hope you enjoy!
