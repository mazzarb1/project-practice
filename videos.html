                 The Lumiere brothers created films, but they couldnâ€™t move the camera because the cameras back then were to heavy and big!  The objective of this assignment was to make a video leaving the camera in place.  The other requirement was making something natural in life, or choreographed.  This video was choreographed and filmed thanks to many friends who spent the time learning the moves and doing the many takes.

*No music was allowed to be added to this film.

 Enjoy!
