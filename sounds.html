             This was my first sound collaboration.  It started off as a simple interview between my roomate and I. 
             I added more sounds to make it come to life more, such as the news room opening sound,
             bathroom sounds, fire alarms, and more.  In addition cut time in between answering and asking questions
             to make it sound more natural.

             This was just natural unchanged sound, we were not allowed to tamper it at all.  It was for a 
             website that has clips from around the world just in naturalness.  So I chose to sit in the TCNJ student 
             center (Stud) for a few minutes and just recorded what was happening during prime time.
